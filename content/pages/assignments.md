| --- | --- |
| Problem Set 1: Linear Regression, Convolution, and Correlation ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps01)) | To do the homework, you will need to download 4.7 MB of data fish.mat ([MAT]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/fish-1)) (Courtesy of Professor Fabrizio Gabbiani of Baylor College of Medicine. Used with permission.) If you have a slow data link, you might want to download the abridged version fish10000.mat ([MAT]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/fish10000)) instead, which is just the first 10000 samples. If you have trouble loading the file on windows ("file may be corrupt"), then try downloading the zipped version fish.zip ([ZIP]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/fish)). |
| Problem Set 2: More Convolution and Correlation ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps02)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem Set 3: Visual Receptive Fields and Least Squares ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps03)) (Courtesy of Prof. Clay Reid of Harvard Medical School. Used with permission.) | Data for #5 ganglion.mat ([MAT]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ganglion)) (Courtesy of Prof. Clay Reid of Harvard Medical School. Used with permission.) |
| Problem Set 4: Operant Matching and Games ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps4_matchpset)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem Set 5: Passive Models of Neurons ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps05)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem Set 6: Extensions of the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps06)) | Code cc.m ([M](/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-29j-introduction-to-computational-neuroscience-spring-2004/assignments/cc.m))  {{< br >}}  {{< br >}}Dayan, Peter, and L. F. Abbott. "Connor-Stevens model." Part of chapter 6 in _Theoretical Neuroscience: Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Neural Systems_. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2001. ISBN: 9780262041997. |
| Problem Set 7: Simulation of Synaptic Inputs ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/ps07)) | Song, S., K. Miller, and L. Abbott. "Competitive Hebbian learning through spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity." _Nature Neuroscience_ 3, no. 9 (2000): 919-926. |
